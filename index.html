            <p>Son of legendary inventor and weapons contractor Howard Stark. When Tony Stark is assigned to give a
                weapons presentation to an Iraqi unit led by Lt. Col. James Rhodes, he's given a ride on enemy lines.
                That ride ends badly when Stark's Humvee that he's riding in is attacked by enemy combatants. He
                survives - barely - with a chest full of shrapnel and a car battery attached to his heart.</p>
